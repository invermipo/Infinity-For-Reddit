Microwind 3.1 is developed by Microwind, a company based in Toulouse, France, that provides innovative and shorter learning curve tools for CMOS layout designs. Microwind software is used by thousands of budding engineers and teachers across the globe[^2^]. Microwind 3.1 supports various CMOS technologies, ranging from 0.35 micron to 14 nanometer[^2^]. It also includes features such as process variation analysis, leakage power consumption analysis, fault testing, and very simple microprocessor design[^2^].
 
Microwind 3.1 consists of four main modules: DSCH, Nano lambda, PROtutor, and PROthumb[^2^]. DSCH is a schematic editor that allows users to draw and simulate mixed-signal circuits. Nano lambda is a layout editor that enables users to create and edit CMOS layouts with nanometer precision. PROtutor is a tool that helps users understand the MOS characteristics and parameters. PROthumb is a tool that connects the layout editor to an external simulator for verification of CMOS circuits.
